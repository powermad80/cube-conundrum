# Cube Conundrum - Advent of Code 2023 Day 2

---

Problem: Given a game of pulling dice from a bag and a list of outcomes of many iterations of this game, determine which of the listed games in input.txt are actually possible given a certain number of dice stated to be contained in the bag.

Part 2: find the minimum set of each color of dice that could be contained in each game to make it possible, then multiply these numbers together, and add sum these numbers for all games.
